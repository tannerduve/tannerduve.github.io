You describe <em>what</em> should happen as an abstract tree of effects, leaving open <em>how</em> you want it to happen. By decoupling syntax from semantics like this you gain full control over how programs are evaluated and interpreted - for example we could interpret a syntax tree in multiple ways:</p> <ul> <li>Run it directly</li> <li>Pretty print it</li> <li>Analyze it statically</li> </ul> <p>Each of these corresponds to a different interpreter. This approach also allows effects to be combined without you having to get tangled up in monad transformers. <em>Freer</em> monads are a flexible generalization of free monads that make combining and interpreting effects even easier.</p> <p>This four-part series will introduce the freer monad in Lean — Part 1 will introduce the categorical theory and motivation of the free monad and walk through its implementation in Lean. In part 2 we will further explore some theory and study initial algebras and catamorphisms, and how they give rise to canonical interpreters for effectful computation trees. In part 3 we will study the universal property of free monads and what it provides for us as programmers. Finally in part 4, we will use what we’ve learned to build and verify a real interpreter for a small language, making elegant use of freeness to combine effectful computations.</p> <p>This series assumes you know basic concepts from both category theory and functional programming, including functors, monads, and inductive datatypes.</p> <ol> <li><a href="/blog/freer-monad/part1/">Part 1 — Defining the Free Monad in Lean</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/freer-monad/part2/">Part 2 — Initial Algebras, Catamorphisms, and Interpreters</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/freer-monad/part3/">Part 3 — Universal Morphisms and Effect Handlers</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/freer-monad/part4/">Part 4 — Tutorial: A Verified Interpreter with Side Effects</a></li> </ol> </body></html>
