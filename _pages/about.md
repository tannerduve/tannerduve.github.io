Hi! I'm Tanner. I am currently a formal verification software engineer at [Nexus](https://nexus.xyz), working on building and verifying the [Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine](https://nexus.xyz/zkvm). I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with an MSE in computer science and a BA in mathematical logic. My academic interests include formal verification, programming languages, category theory, type theory, and all things logic.

I am an avid user of the [Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html) theorem prover and I have done contracting work formalizing mathematical proofs for [Harmonic](https://harmonic.fun/index) and [Project Numina](https://projectnumina.ai). Independently I have made contributions to [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) in the area of mathematical logic.

I have participated in the [Adjoint School](https://adjointschool.com/index.html), doing research in categorical semantics of compositional reinforcement learning, under supervision of [Georgios Bakirtzis](https://bakirtzis.net) and [Michail Savvas](https://michailsavvas.github.io).

Outside of work I enjoy reading philosophy, in particular analytic philosophy, philosophy of mind and consciousness, metaphysics, and Eastern philosophy and mysticism. I am also learning guitar (primarily 90s grunge) and am passionate about veganism and total liberation for all beings.
