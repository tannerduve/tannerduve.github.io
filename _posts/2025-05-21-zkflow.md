This post will describe **ZkFlow**, a small source language and compiler for building zero-knowledge proofs, formally verified in Lean.

Will be covered:
- the syntax and semantics of a declarative arithmetic/boolean expression language,
- the ZkLean constraint system DSL developed by Galois for specifying ZK constraints
- how source programs are compiled into circuits
- formal verification of the compiler
- a python script which parses programs in the source language, runs the compiler, and outputs an image of the generated ZK circuit
