This post will introduce the freer monad in Lean, from categorical and type theoretic foundations to applications in programming.

Covered topics:

- **Free objects** in mathematics: groups, vector spaces, lists
- The **free monad**, categorically and in code
- Why **strict positivity** breaks the free monad in Lean
- The **freer monad**: a more free, structurally lawful fix
- Lean code and proofs
- **Mini tutorial**: using the freer monad to build a small interpreter

Not a beginner tutorial. Assumes you're comfortable with functors, monads, and basics of category theory.
