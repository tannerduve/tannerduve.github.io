🚧 Under construction 📐

This post will discuss the **freer monad**, how it is implemented in Lean, its applications in programming, and its category-theoretic structure.

We’ll look at:
- free monads in general, and why the free-er monad
- the categorical construction of **free monads** and their relationship to syntax,
- strict positivity and inductive families in Lean,
- and how the freer monad enables operational semantics by separating structure from interpretation.
