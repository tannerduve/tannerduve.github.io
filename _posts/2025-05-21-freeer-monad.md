🚧 Under construction 📐

This post will discuss the **freer monad**, aka the **operational monad**, how it is implemented in Lean, its applications in programming, and its category-theoretic underpinnings.

We’ll look at:
- **free monads** - their categorical construction and their uses in programming
- strict positivity in proof assistants: enter the **freer monad**
- implementation and some proofs in Lean
- how the freer monad enables operational semantics by separating structure from interpretation.
