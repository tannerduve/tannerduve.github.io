This post will introduce the freer monad in Lean, from categorical and type theoretic foundations to applications in programming.

- Why **strict positivity** breaks the free monad in Lean
- The **freer monad**: a more free, strictly positive fix
- Lean code and proofs
- **Mini tutorial**: using the freer monad to build a small interpreter
