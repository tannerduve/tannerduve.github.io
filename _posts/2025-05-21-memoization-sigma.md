ðŸš§ Under construction

This post shows how to verify a **dynamic programming solution** inside Lean with a novel use of dependent types.

Weâ€™ll:
- solve a competitive programming problem with a memoization table,
- use `Î£`-types (dependent pairs) to pair table entries with proofs of their correctness,
- and **verify correctness as we go**, encoding the DP invariant into the structure of the computation itself.
